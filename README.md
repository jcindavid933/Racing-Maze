# Simple-Games

I created simple games using Python 3.6.3 with Pygame. Written in 2018.

**Super Mario Dodge** is the first game I created using Pygame. This is simply a game where the user has to control the Mario Cart from hitting the blocks. The user has the ability to move up, down, right or left in order to successfully dodge the blocks. I have set up the blocks to become wider and faster over time, in order to make the difficulty harder.
