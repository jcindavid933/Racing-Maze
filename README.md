# Racing Maze

I created Racing Maze using Python 3.6.3 with Pygame. Written in 2018.

**Racing Maze** is the first game I created using Pygame. This was my first project I created outside of school and work. It is a 2D racing game which consists of obstacles such as a PacMan character "Blinky" and brick walls. The main objective of this game is to make the car hit the trophy, which will complete the stage.
