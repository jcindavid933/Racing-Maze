# Racing Maze

I created Racing Maze using Python 3.6.3 with Pygame. Written in 2018.

**Racing Maze** is the first game I created using Pygame. This was my first project I created outside of school and work. It is a 2D racing game which consists of obstacles such as a PacMan character "Blinky" and brick walls. The main objective of this game is to make the car hit the trophy, which will complete the stage.

**Controls:**

I. For **Menu:** 

The user can select any stage or exit the game using the mouse. If the user wishes to use the keyboard, the user can use the up/down or right/left arrow keys to pick which option the user wishes. After selecting the desired option, pressing enter will execute that option.

II. For **Gameplay:**

**UP ARROW:** ACCELERATION/ DRIVE FORWARD

**DOWN ARROW:** DEACCELERATION/ DRIVE BACKWARDS

**RIGHT ARROW:** DRIFT RIGHT

**LEFT ARROW:** DRIFT LEFT

**"P" KEY:** PAUSE GAME

**"ESCAPE" KEY:** EXIT GAME

**DESIGN-TOOL:** PAINT S (MAC OS)
